# A letter to stargazers and users of this subproject
Dear readers,

I'm sorry to tell you that the development of WebMP is halted because of following reasons.

First, a vital examination is approaching, and I have to prepare for it.

Second, my mother forbids me from going to the radio station, so currently I have no private access to any public desktop computers.„ÄÅ

Development of this subproject is likely to be resumed during minor and major holidays exclude weekends.

I will upload assets of **WebMP 1.0 alpha 2** for public convenience some time.

I surely feel pityful, but, I **promise**, and I **declare**, **DEVELOPMENT NEVER STOPS**!!!

Sincerely,

SkyFuInMC of WebMP subproject
